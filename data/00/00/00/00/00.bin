  |   INVERSUS Deluxe is a competitive and cooperative arcade shooter       |
  |   with a mind-bending twist. Player movement is constrained to          |
  |   opposite colors of a black and white grid. My walls are your paths    |
  |   and your walls are my paths. Each shot flips tile colors in an        |
  |   attempt to block, trap and close in on the enemy.                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   With full support for solo play, local multiplayer and online         |
  |   multiplayer, INVERSUS Deluxe is great for gaming on the go or         |
  |   having a party with friends. You can even set up games with a mix     |
  |   of local and online players to fit your needs. The full               |
  |   single-player and local-multiplayer experience can also be played     |
  |   while waiting for a match online!                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In VERSUS mode, up to four players can compete across thirty-nine     |
  |   different maps in 1v1 or 2v2 battles. Head straight into online       |
  |   ranked multiplayer, train against five tiers of AI bots, or           |
  |   customize the rules in local games and private online lobbies.        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Take on the challenge of ARCADE mode alone or with a friend as you    |
  |   fight for survival on eleven stages. Create devastating chain         |
  |   attacks through the enemy swarms as you compete for high scores on    |
  |   the global leaderboards!                                              |
